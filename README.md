GIT PUSH ORIGIN DEV AFTER EVERY SESSION

Welcome to the readme of Project Riffbox! 

This will be my first ever project to display as much as I have learned over the past four weeks in training.

My intention is to create a website that users can find music to listen to from a variety of genres that they choose! 

I created 5 html pages to create the webpage that will host my project, currently the only webpage with user input functions is input.html,
also I am also in the process of creating hyperlinks which connect all of the pages together for easy viewing.

Set up all of the app.routes for each html and some basic text and titles on the pages to provide the website something to load, the home button that redirects
to the instructions page currently doesn't work and the jpg is not loading.

Created a navbar with three functioning links to other html pages.

The navbar is now working but when I run app.py, it does not load up the home.html or any others and I need to manually add /home to enter the website etc.

I resolved the issue and now the website opens as expected, I will now tidy up the files and ensure that everything still links.


Created  routes.py, create.py, license.md files in main directory.

Created Application folder, Images and Templates folders where moved into this directory.

Cleaned up app.py and moved code into their proper files, and linked everything together. 

Testing the website resulted in everything currently added functioning as expected minus the JPG image for the home page. 

Hyperlink 2 in instructions currently does not work as the function for Input has not yet been created.

Created dev branch to push everything to GitHub, then once I am happy push everything to the main branch.

Updated the Index to describe the available genres, inputted a quote for myself along with some html practice on seperating information.

Created the forms.py file and managed to get the Input webpage working with some stringfields although they do not register anything yet.
